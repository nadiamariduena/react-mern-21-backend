## Reason

[nodejs error EADDRINUSE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42751932/nodejs-error-eaddrinuse)

<br>

> Your site.js **tries to listen twice on that port or something (another process) is already listening on port** 3000. Find the service and stop/kill it. This command should help:

##### 1.

- lsof -i | grep 3000

<br>

##### 2.

- killall node (this one worked for me)

# üî¥ error no.2

#### I get this error when trying to send a POST REQUEST in postman

```javascript
keyPattern: {
  username: null;
}
```

### the set up i have in postman

- the URL: **http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register**

- body
- raw
- JSON

```javascript

{
"username": "carag hol",
"email": "rajopd@gmail.com",
"password": "vvvdorejj"
 }
```

#### then I did the following:

1. created a new collection **(the reason of the mistake)**
2. I set up the POST request
3. then i added the object
4. while being connected to the **PORT 3000** (inside my index.js)
5. inside the console the **server is connected succesfully**

# ü§¶

### I was doing all correctly at one exception, I messed with the variable inside the .env

- in the beginning I had another variable there , the **superFreak** as you can see it in the image(collections), then i changed it to **shop** as seen in the video tutorial, but **I DONT KNOW** if the fact of changing the variable while the server is connected **mess things up**, because after i changed the variable things went wrong.

```javascript

 ongodb.net/shop?retry
```

<br>
<br>

#### Then after many different tests, I decided to change the variable again to see if the problem came from there.

<br>

- So I shut down the server
- I changed the variable to **inspectorgadget**

```javascript

 ongodb.net/inspectorgadget?retry
```

<br>

#### steps:

- then i turned the server **on** again
- I went to postman

- created a new collection
- I set up the POST request
- then i added the object
- while being **succesfully** connected to the **PORT 3000** (inside my index.js)

> **Like so:**

## JUST TO BE SURE üêøÔ∏è

#### I deleted all again, then i repeated the 'steps' from above

- Now i am 100% the **error** came from there

### So after i deleted all a third time, i concluded that the variable you add in the .env (collection related)is the parent collection, and shouldn't be touched, this collection will be parent of all the other you will create in postman

- so when you go to postman when you just added this variable, add the specific name that is inside the **.env**, repeat the steps, and after you send the first data to **MONGO** and that all went well, after that you can add whatever child you want.
