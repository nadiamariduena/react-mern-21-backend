# üêù

# Let's Begin!

## 1. Install the dependencies

```javascript
// copy and paste the following
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons   react-router-dom node-sass@4.14.1 styled-components

// npm i styled-components
```

 <br>


### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

<br>

> Here you can see how the [**emmet extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) auto complete and automatically create the import on top of the file

 
<br>

<!-- phase 2 after, default 1 -->

# ROUTES / COLLECTIONS

<br>
<br>

### Now that we know how routes work, let's create the <u>COLLECTIONS</u> in mongoDB

<br>

> **The collections** are going to match with the pages we have in the [frontend](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/react-mern-21-frontend), such as the **USER |CART | ORDER | PRODUCT**

 <br>
 <br>

### START by creating a new folder:

- Create the folder in the same directory as the node modules(not inside the node_modules)

- Call the folder: **models**

<br>

##### Inside the models folder create:

- User.js (dont confuse the user with the user inside the **routes folder**)
- Product.js
- Order.js
- Cart.js

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Inside the User.js create the Schema

[<img src="img/schema-bee.gif"/>]()

<br>

### THE SCHEMA / MODEL

> **A document schema is a JSON object that allows you to define the shape and content of documents and embedded documents in a collection.** ... Document schemas follow the same JSON schema specification as document validation in the MongoDB server.

<br>

#### Defining and creating models

> Models are defined using the Schema interface. **The Schema allows you to define the fields stored in each document along with their validation requirements and default values.** In addition, you can define static and instance helper methods to make it easier to work with your data types, and also virtual properties that you can use like any other field, but which aren't actually stored in the database (we'll discuss a bit further below).

- Schemas are then "compiled" into models using the mongoose.model() method. Once you have a model you can use it to find, create, update, and delete objects of the given type.

<br>

### üî¥ Important to read: [Schema Basics](http://learnmongodbthehardway.com/schema/schemabasics/)

- [Many to Many relation in mongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Pltb46n-M)

<br>

[<img src="img/shema1.png"/>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose)

<br>
<br>

# üçØ

#### FIRST WE WILL START BY STRUCTURING THE USER SCHEMA AND FROM THERE. WE WILL SET UP THEN THE USER AUTHENTICATION.

- the Schema below will serve to structure the users data

##### [check another example i did few months ago](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/ecommerce2/blob/master/src/docs/USER_AUTH.md)

<br>

- You have to always use **CAPITAL** in the name of your Schema:

```javascript
const UserSchema;
```

<br>

<br>

#### I added something more to the schema, lets see if i get errors when i will try it in POSTMAN

<br>

- I added **firstname** and **lastName** in more of what you can see in the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMiRZ1iRC0A). min 23:05

<br>

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const userShema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
    min: 3,
    max: 20,
  },
  lastName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
    min: 3,
    max: 20,
  },
  userName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
    unique: true, //unique:we cannot create another username with the same username
    lowercase: true,
  },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  isAdmin: {
    type: boolean, //because its going to be: TRUE or FALSE
    default: false, // since its false, this user is NOT going to be an Admin
  },
});
```

<br>

#### Here we are telling that 'This user' is not going to be an Admin: default: false

```javascript
isAdmin: {
    type: boolean, //because its going to be: TRUE or FALSE
    default: false, // since its false, this user is NOT going to be an Admin
}
```

<br>

#### A last thing

- add the following:

```javascript
createAt: Date.now();
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### But we dont have to do this, since Mongo has a function for that:

```javascript
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

<br>

#### What is timestamps true in mongoose?

> The {timestamps: true} option creates a createdAt and updatedAt field on our models that contain timestamps which will get automatically updated when our model changes. The last line mongoose. model('User', UserSchema); registers our schema with mongoose.

##### [Check the differences with & without](https://dev.to/iamharsh/comment/ohl0)

<br>
<br>

### Now that we have the basic Schema, lets export it!

> Here we export the Schema:

- 2 important things to not mess up with here: üî¥

- **"User"**, **UserSchema**

> **module.exports** = mongoose.model(**"User"**, **UserSchema**);

<br>
  <br>

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

<br></br>;

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    userName: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      trim: true,
      unique: true, //unique:we cannot create another username with the same username
      lowercase: true,
    },
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true },
    isAdmin: {
      type: Boolean, //because its going to be: TRUE or FALSE
      default: false, // since its false, this user is NOT going to be an Admin
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

//
// Here we export the Schema:
module.exports = mongoose.model("User", UserSchema);
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

# üçä

#### Now that we are done with the USER model, lets create another one.

- COPY the Schema from the **USER**, and paste it inside the **Product.js**

<br>

#### Replace it with the following:

<br>

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    desc: { type: String, required: true },
    img: { type: String, required: true },
    categories: { type: Array }, //because it can have more than 1 category
    size: { type: String },
    color: { type: String },
    price: { type: Number, required: true },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

module.exports = mongoose.model("Product", ProductSchema);
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

# ü••

#### Now that we are done with the Cart model, lets create another one.

- COPY the Schema from the **Cart**, and paste it inside the **Order.js**

<br>

<br>

#### Replace it with the following:

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const CartSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    userId: { type: String, required: true },
    products: [
      {
        productId: {
          type: String,
        },
        quantity: {
          type: Number,
          default: 1, //the logic here is that when you add a product, you add it
          //one at the time, not 2 or 3 every time you click
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

module.exports = mongoose.model("Cart", CartSchema);
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

# üçç

#### Now that we are done with the Product model, lets create another one.

- COPY the Schema from the **Product**, and paste it inside the **Cart.js**

<br>

- [Many to Many relation in mongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Pltb46n-M)

<br>

#### Replace it with the following:

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const OrderSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  // This will be used after purchasing the Items
  {
    userId: { type: String, required: true },
    products: [
      {
        productId: {
          type: String,
        },
        quantity: {
          type: Number,
          default: 1,
        },
      },
    ],
    amount: { type: Number, required: true },
    //BELOW:its not going to be type:String because at that point
    // We will be using STRIPE, and its going to give us an object with
    // different lines/fields, similar to what i had here.
    // CHECK the Readme:for schemas
    address: { type: Object, required: true }, //after purchasing we will need user address
    status: { type: String, default: "pending" },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

module.exports = mongoose.model("Order", OrderSchema);
```

<br>

### BELOW:

```javascript
 address: { type: Object, required: true }, //after purchasing we will need user address
```

its not going to be type:String, because at that point we will be using **STRIPE**, and its going to give us an object with different lines/fields, similar to what i had here.[countries = Object.entries(shippingCountries)](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/e-commerce-react-stripe/blob/master/src/components/CheckoutForm/AddressForm.jsx)

<br>

- [Object.keys()](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/e-commerce-react-stripe/tree/token-shipping-Countries)
