# üêù

# Let's Begin!

## 1. Install the dependencies

```javascript
// copy and paste the following
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons   react-router-dom node-sass@4.14.1 styled-components

// npm i styled-components
```

 <br>


### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

<br>

> Here you can see how the [**emmet extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) auto complete and automatically create the import on top of the file

[<img src="/src/img/compo_after_install_emet.gif"/>]()

<br>

# üêª

<!-- phase 2 after, default 1 -->

# ROUTES

<br>
<br>

### Routes work like the Mall Analogy the teacher used

<p>

> **In the shopping mall you have different stores:** <br> > **Each store** has a **unique** specialization like (books,shoes,paper) and each of them has an unique address (like floor, number etc), and this is equivalent to a PORT. Inside of a port there s always a distinct
> service on your pc that does something very specific, for example: you have different PORTS to listen to incoming EMAILS, different ports for accepting a file
> load etc...

<br>

- Each specialized store on the server has its own address, this
  are the programms that run on the server </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# üè≠

### We will be creating a REST API so we will use some 'end points'

- End points like the one here below:

```html
// api is one end point, the other one is: **/api/test**
```

<br>

```javascript
app.get("/api/test", () => {
  console.log("endpoints test is successful");
});
```

<br>
<br>

#### The way we will see if its working, is by doing some request to the port 5000(to mimic it, we will be using the browser)

- type **http://localhost:5000/api/test**

<br>

# üì¶

### result

```javascript
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Started server on port
DBConnection Successful
endpoints test is successful

```

<br>
<br>

#### Now let's move the endpoints to a _folder exclusively_ for them, as it's not a good idea to add them inside the index.js

<br>

- 1 Create a NEW FOLDER

- 2 Name it: **routes**

- 3 Inside the **routes** create a file, name it **user.js**

- 4 INside the user.js, create the route for a user

<br>
<BR>

# REQ AND RES

#### The req or request:

> is what the user is going to send to us, in the
> form of data, such as: username, email or any input, even emptiness...

<br>

#### The res or response:

> after the req, we are going to send a res or response to the user:

- like so:

```javascript
res.send("user test rainbow cringe is successful");
```

# üêí

```javascript
//  user.js
const router = require("express").Router();

router.get("/userTest", (req, res) => {
  res.send("user test rainbow cringe is successful");
});
```

<br>
<br>

## EXPORT THE ROUTE

- **module.exports = router;**

```javascript
const router = require("express").Router();

/*
The req or request: is what the user is going to send to us, in the
form of data, such as: username, email or any input, even emptiness...

after the req, we are going to send a res or response to the user:

like so: 

*/

router.get("/userTest", (req, res) => {
  res.send("user test rainbow cringe is successful");
});

module.exports = router;
```

## IMPORT THE ROUTE

- Go to index.js

```javascript
const userRoute = require("./routes/user");
```

#### then use it

```javascript
app.use("/api/user", userRoute);
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### S o what we have until now:

```javascript
// user.js
// 1 here we require express
const router = require("express").Router();

router.get("/userTest", (req, res) => {
  //2 here we send a response to the req of the user
  res.send("user test rainbow cringe is successful");
});
//3 we export it
module.exports = router;

/*




*/
//index.js

//4 here we require the data from user.js
const userRoute = require("./routes/user");
//
//
//
//dotenv
dotenv.config();
//
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.MONGO_RAINBOW_URL)
  .then(() => console.log("DBConnection Successful"))
  .catch((err) => console.log("error"));

//5 here we use it
app.use("/api/user", userRoute);

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
  console.log(`Started server on port`);
});
```

#### Now type this on the browser to see the answer

- **http://localhost:5000/api/user/userTest**

<br>

### result

```javascript
user test rainbow cringe is successful
```

<br>

### [Using HTTP Methods for RESTful Services ](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)

> The **HTTP** verbs comprise a major portion of our ‚Äúuniform interface‚Äù constraint and provide us the action counterpart to the noun-based resource. **The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called)** are <u>POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. üëç </u>These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or **CRUD (create, read, update, delete)** ) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently. Of those less-frequent methods, OPTIONS and HEAD are used more often than others.

<br>

- Below is a table summarizing recommended return values of the primary HTTP methods in combination with the resource URIs:

<br>

- **click** on the img to read more:

[<img src="img/CRUD-post-get-put-delete.jpg"/>](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Now Lets Continue

<br>

- Create a **POST** Request

- Go to the **user.js** and add a **POST** method

<br>

> Every time the user is going to add any input, you should pass 'body'

```javascript
//
//   POST
//
router.post("/userPostTest", (req, res) => {
  //every time the user is going to add any input, you
  //should pass   'body'
  const username = req.body.username;
  console.log(username);
});
//
//
//
module.exports = router;
```

<br>

### Since we dont have any input in the BROWSER we can mimic that by using [POSTMAN](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-postman-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

- Install it on ubuntu like so

```javascript
sudo snap install postman
```

### Once its installed

- open the app in your computer and login, it will launch a page in the browser

<br>

### A last thing before a test:

- Modify this insid ethe index.js

<br>

- Change **/api/user** for **/api/users**

```javascript
//END POINTS
//if you are using a REST API this will be plural: instead of user , users
app.use("/api/users", userRoute);
// app.get("/api/test", () => {
//   console.log("endpoints test is successful");
// });
```

<br>

[<img src="img/postman_test1.gif"/>]()

<br>
<br>

#### But before we can actually get something , we have to set up the JSON part in our application, as right now it s not designed to 'take json objects {}, for that reason if we clicked 'send' nothing will happen.

<br>

# üçä

# BODY PARSER

> **What does body parser do in Express?** <br> > **Body-parser extract** the entire body portion of an incoming request
> stream and exposes it on req. body . <br><br> **The middleware** was a part of Express.js earlier but now you have to install it separately. <br><br> This body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.

### Lets set it up

- ADD THIS inside the **index.js**

```javascript
//
//---------------------
//   BODY PARSER
//---------------------
// ALWAYS add the BODY PARSER before the routes
//
app.use(express.json());
//
//
```

### Check that you have the code in such way:

```javascript
//                          user.js
//
const router = require("express").Router();

/*
The req or request: is what the user is going to send to us, in the
form of data, such as: username, email or any input, even emptiness...

after the req, we are going to send a res or response to the user:

like so: 

*/

//api/user/userPostTest
//
//   GET
//
router.get("/usertest", (req, res) => {
  res.send("user test rainbow cringe is successful");
});
//
//   POST
//
router.post("/userposttest", (req, res) => {
  //everytime the user is going to add any input, you
  //should pass   'body'
  const username = req.body.username;
  console.log(username);
});
//
//
//
module.exports = router;
/*


                        index.js


*/
//
//
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
// Mongoose
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const dotenv = require("dotenv");
//

//
//dotenv
dotenv.config();
//
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.MONGO_RAINBOW_URL)
  .then(() => console.log("DBConnection Successful"))
  .catch((err) => console.log("error"));
/*




*/

//
//---------------------
//   BODY PARSER
//---------------------
// ALWAYS add the BODY PARSER before the routes
//
app.use(express.json());
//
//
const userRoute = require("./routes/user");
//
//
//
//
//if you are using a REST API this will be plural: instead of user , users
app.use("/api/users", userRoute);
// app.get("/api/test", () => {
//   console.log("endpoints test is successful");
// });

// (()=> {})  callback function
// process.env.PORT || 5000 means: if there is not port at our .env file, then ||, use this number: 500
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
  console.log("Backend server is running!");
});
```

<br>

### Now Open the POSTMAN app not the browser app, because that one didnt work for me!

<br>

- As you can see the first test didn't work for me, Then i tested it in the App and it went SMOOTHLY

<br>

- **http://localhost:5000/api/users/userposttest**

- choose **POST**

- select **body**

- select **JSON**

- While in JSON , add the object:

```javascript
{
"username": "lo√º√ºra"
}

```
