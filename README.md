# Let's Begin!

## 1. Install the dependencies

```javascript
// copy and paste the following
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons   react-router-dom node-sass@4.14.1 styled-components

// npm i styled-components
```

 <br>


### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

<br>

> Here you can see how the [**emmet extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) auto complete and automatically create the import on top of the file

# UPDATE and DELETE

<br>
<br>

#### Now that we have the JWT and <u>the secret key</u> , we can finally continue with the user.js, in this section you will understand better why we are using the JWT

> üî¥ But before: **read** about the MongoDb connection issue in the **errors file**

<br>
<br>

# üç®

## Go to the routes/user.js

- The first thing that we will set up is the .**put** request, to update the data of the user.

> **The PUT method:** PUT is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.<br><br>
> However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. Again, the request body contains a resource representation. **Many feel this is convoluted and confusing. Consequently, this method of creation should be used sparingly, if at all.**

##### [READ MORE | Using HTTP Methods for RESTful Services](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)

##### [READ MORE | intro-Mongo3](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/database-lessons/tree/master/intro-Mongo3)

<br>
<br>

#### So lets add the PUT method inside the router

<br>

- We will create a function router with **2 arguments**, one will be the **user:id** , the other will be the middleware, **this middleware will verify our JWT.**
  <br>

- the Middleware is going to be created in another file as **verifyToken.js**

```javascript
const router = require("express").Router();

///the first argument will be the (:id, ) ,it is a specific user id
// the second argument(1, second argument)  will be middleware
//  to verify our JWT
router.put("/:id");

module.exports = router;
```

<br>
<br>

### Create a new file inside the routes, it will be called 'verifyToken.js'

```javascript
//1 Here you will import the JWT(json web token)

const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

// 2 how are we going to verify the JWT?
// We will set up a middleware then once its ready, we will bring the middleware to the user.js, and we will use this middleware as
// a second argument.
const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {};
```

<br>

# üç¶

### But why do we need a Middleware?

#### What is a MIDDLEWARE

<u>The middleware has access to the request and response
objects and they can modify the request and response
for things like adding authentication, request headers</u>,
parsing request bodies, handling errors and a whole lot
of other useful & essential functionality to your Node.js
applications.

##### example:

> Otis tries to log in to his bank app to view his profile
> and know how much he‚Äôs been paid by Maeve after giving out advice<u>{The client sends a request} before the server sends out his bank profile{response}</u> he is required to be authenticated{middleware function}. **The authentication, in this case, is a middleware function** that must be executed before a response is sent out! \*\*If the middleware function that is being executed doesn‚Äôt end the request-response cycle it must call next () to allow the other middleware functions on the queue get executed!\*\*

##### READ MORE : [Understanding Express Middleware{A beginners guide} ](https://dev.to/ghvstcode/understanding-express-middleware-a-beginners-guide-g73)

<br>

##### the page example(not ours)

```javascript
// MIDDLEWARE
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.method, re.path);

  next();
});
```

- From the snippet above **we can note that the middleware is executed every time the application receives a request. This is because we didn't define a specific route the middleware function should run on!** <u>(IN OUR APP its different,as we are already setting it up inside the user.js)</u> to do that, we simply **pass the middleware only in the route we want it to get executed in as the second argument right after defining the route path**!Middlewares can be declared to allow for reusability and to follow the DRY principle in cases where we would be carrying out the same function repeatedly!

<br>
<br>

### _NEXT_ FUNCTION üåû

The next function is a function in the Express router
which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding
the current middleware.

<br>

### _HEADERS_ üåû

> **1.** HTTP Headers are an important part of the API request and ..response as they represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. ... Headers carry information for: Request and Response Body. Request Authorization.

##### [Request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header)

> **2.** The Http2ServerRequest.headers is an inbuilt application programming interface of class Http2ServerRequest within the http2 module which is used to get the request/response headers object..

##### [Node.js Http2ServerRequest.headers Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-http2serverrequest-headers-method/)

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Now lets Continue

#### 1 Here you will import the JWT(json web token)

```javascript
// 1
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
```

#### 2 how are we going to verify the JWT?

```javascript
// the middleware function
// 2
const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {};
```

### we will use a Header to get the requests

```javascript
// this is the header with the token that we will be adding in the postman
//3
const authHeader = req.headers.token;
```

#### 'if this exists and its not undefined:'

```javascript
//if there is no 'authHeader', we are going to return 'what is inside the else'
//   4
if (authHeader) {
}
```

<br>

#### "Authorization Required"

```javascript
  } else {
    //   Unsuccessful
    //   401 which is 'not authenticated
    // 5
    return res.status(401).json("Authorization Required");
  }
```

#### So if we have a token, we should verify it:

```javascript
 //6
    //it will verify the token and the JWT_SECRET_KEY, after that
    // if the token, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY are incorrect it will send either an error  (err) or (the data of the user, in case of success)

    jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY, (err, user) =>{}
```

#### this is for the token, so if there is an error such as: 'token expire or wrong token', it will launch the err message

```javascript
// 7
if (err) res.status(403).json("token is not valid");
```

#### the success case is the user data

```javascript
//8. the success case is the user data
//So if everything is good, we are going to assign the user data to our req
req.user = user;
```

<br>

#### after we assign the user data to the req.user

```javascript
      //9 after we assign the user data to the req.user
      //   we conclude it with next(), next is like the
      next();
      //
      //
    });
//
//
//EXPORT
// Since its a function, you will export it like so: { verifyToken }
module.exports = { verifyToken };
```

[<img src="img/relay_game_next-analogy.jpg"/>]()

#### üî¥ the above image is the next() function containing the middleware (this middlewarw is the stick hold by the red ) being send to the user.js (the blue)to be used as the 2 argument.

<br>

<br>

### This is what we have until now

```javascript
//1 Here you will import the JWT(json web token)
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

//
//
//
//
// -------------------------------------------
//
//           VERIFY A TOKEN
//             middleware
//
// -------------------------------------------
//
//
// 2 how are we going to verify the JWT?
const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
  //
  //3
  const authHeader = req.headers.token;
  //
  //if there is no 'authHeader', we are going to return 'what is inside the else'
  //   4
  if (authHeader) {
    //   successful

    // So if we have a token, we should verify it:
    //it will verify the token and the JWT_SECRET_KEY, after that
    // if the token, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY are incorrect it will send either an error  (err) or (the data of the user, in case of success)
    //6
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY, (err, user) => {
      //
      //7 this is for the token, so if there is an error such as:
      //   token expire or wrong token, it will launch the err message
      if (err) res.status(403).json("token is not valid");
      //8. the success case is the user data
      //So if everything is good, we are going to assign the user data to our req
      req.user = user;
      //9 after we assign the user data to the req.user
      //   we conclude it with next(), next is like the
      next();
      //
      //
    });
    //
  } else {
    //   Unsuccessful
    //   401 which is 'not authenticated
    // 5
    return res.status(401).json("Authorization Required");
  }

  //
  //
};

module.exports = { verifyToken };
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Back to the user.js

##### import the verifyToken.js

```javascript
// import
const { verifyToken } = require("./verifyToken");

const router = require("express").Router();
// 2 arguments
router.put("/:id", verifyToken);

module.exports = router;
```

#### now we can use (req, res)=>{}

- This **verifyToken, (req, res)** is the second argument
- From this 2 argument we will grab the

```javascript
const { verifyToken } = require("./verifyToken");

const router = require("express").Router();
// 2 arguments
router.put("/:id", verifyToken, (req, res) => {
  // If this req. made by the user.id  is equal === to this /:id
  // it means its the same user and he/she is allowed to make updates
  //   to this user information
  // : stand for params
  // i will also check if its an Admin:  || req.user.isAdmin)
  if (req.user.id === req.params.id || req.user.isAdmin) {
    //   in this case we can update our user, but if
    // we write it like so we will repeat ourself
    // So we will create another function inside the
    // verifyToken.js
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

<br>
<br>

### To prevent of writing this function again and gain we will implement it in one place and then grab the data we need from it every time we need it, a bit like a HOOK

- Go to the verifyToken.js and add the following function:

```javascript
//
// -------------------------------------------
//                  2
//           VERIFY A TOKEN
//             Authorization
//
// -------------------------------------------
//

const verifyTokenAndAuthorization = (req, res, next) => {
  //1
  verifyToken(req, res, () => {
    // this is the same function we were creating inside the user.js
    if (req.user.id === req.params.id || req.user.isAdmin) {
      // if the user is an params.id user or if he is an admin, we can continue and make updates
      next();
    } else {
      // If its not :
      res.status(403).json("You are not alowed to do that!");
    }
  });
};

//
// EXPORT the 2 functions
module.exports = { verifyToken, verifyTokenAndAuthorization };
```

<br>
<br>
