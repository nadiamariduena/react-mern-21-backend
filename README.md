# Let's Begin!

## 1. Install the dependencies

```javascript
// copy and paste the following
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons   react-router-dom node-sass@4.14.1 styled-components

// npm i styled-components
```

 <br>


### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

<br>

> Here you can see how the [**emmet extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) auto complete and automatically create the import on top of the file

<!-- phase 2 after, default 1 -->

# ROUTES / FOR THE SCHEMAS

<br>
<br>

### Now that we have the SCHEMAS, lets delete the test routes we have inside the user.js

<br>

- Inside the **routes/user.js**

#### DELETE THE FOLLOWING:

<br>

```javascript
//
//   GET
//
router.get("/usertest", (req, res) => {
  res.send("user test rainbow cringe is successful");
});
//
//   POST
//
router.post("/userposttest", (req, res) => {
  //everytime the user is going to add any input, you
  //should pass   'body'
  const username = req.body.username;
  console.log(username);
});
//
```

 <br>
 <br>

### Now COPY what is left and PASTE it to the new routes, these new routes will match the freshly created SCHEMAS

```javascript
const router = require("express").Router();

//
//
module.exports = router;
```

<br>
<br>

# üçØ ü•õ

### CREATE THE ROUTES

> Since we already have the **route** for the user.js, we only have to create the following inside the **routes folder**:

<br>

##### <u>all in lowercase</u>

- cart.js
- order.js
- products.js

<br>

### Now paste this inside each one of them:

```javascript
const router = require("express").Router();

//
//
module.exports = router;
```

<br>

### Now that we are ready, lets create the first USER
